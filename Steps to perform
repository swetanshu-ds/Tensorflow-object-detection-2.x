1. Go to - https://github.com/tensorflow/models
2. Then go to models -> research  -> object detection -> colab tutorials 
3. Inside colab tutorials - click on  object_detection_tutorial.ipynb and open in colab
4. Now connect and mount google drive 
5. Now run till 
%%bash
cd models/research/
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
7.  After running this cell stop ,you will see inside models research object detection protos there are new files created with extension .py
8. Inside models ->research -> object detection -> packages -> tf2 
9. Copy path of the setup.py
10. Change the below code 
    %%bash 
    cd models/research
    pip install .
    
    -> 
    %%bash 
    cd models/research
    cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py . 
    pip install .

11. Till here in the above steps installing of libraries in colab are completed
12. From here downside -  Inference using Pretrained Model
13. Now run till instance segmentation and you will see two images doing object_detection
14. Now go to https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md
15. Copy address of EfficientDet D1 640x640
16. Paste it http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32.tar.gz
17. Go to Loader Section which contains def load_model(model_name):
18. in the base url = change the current url 'http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/' 
19. to 'http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/'
20. And  now run it again
21 . Now go to the Detection and replace the model_name from -> 'ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17' to -> 'efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32'
22. Now run the Detection
23. Now run all before Instance Segmentation
24. Now upload some different images in jpg format from unsplash
25. Upload those new images in models -> research-> object_detection -> test_images in test_images
25. Now all before Instance Segmentation
26. Now till here our model infernecing is done
