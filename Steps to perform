protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
7.  After running this cell stop ,you will see inside models research object detection protos there are new files created with extension .py
8. Inside models ->research -> object detection -> packages -> tf2 
9. Copy path of the setup.py
10. Change the below code 
    %%bash 
    cd models/research
    pip install .
    
    -> 
    %%bash 
    cd models/research
    cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py . 
    pip install .

11. Till here in the above steps installing of libraries in colab are completed
